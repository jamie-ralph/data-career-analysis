In this project I'll use data from StackOverflow's 2019 Developer Survey to explore
the characteristics of data analysts and data scientists. This project was inspired by Julia Silge's amazing analysis of [gender and salary in the tech industry](https://juliasilge.com/blog/salary-gender/). 

The pre-processing steps are executed in *prepare_data.r*. To summarise, respondents are filtered as:

* salary above \$30,000 and below \$2,000,000
    
* full-time only
    
* self-identified data analyst or data scientist

#### What do data analysts and data scientists earn?
