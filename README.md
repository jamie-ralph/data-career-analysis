**Analysing careers in data with the StackOverflow Developer Survey
2019**
================

<br>

In this project I’ll use data from StackOverflow’s 2019 Developer Survey
to explore the characteristics of data analysts and data scientists.
This project was inspired by Julia Silge’s amazing analysis of [gender
and salary in the tech
industry](https://juliasilge.com/blog/salary-gender/).

The pre-processing steps are executed in *prepare\_data.r*. To
summarise, respondents are filtered as:

  - salary above $30,000 and below $2,000,000

  - full-time only

  - self-identified data analyst or data scientist

#### What do data analysts and data scientists earn?
