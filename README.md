**Analysing careers in data with the StackOverflow Developer Survey
2019**
================

<br>

This project was inspired by Julia Silge’s amazing analysis of [gender
and salary in the tech
industry](https://juliasilge.com/blog/salary-gender/). There’s a lot of
cool analysis that can be done with the survey data, but I’ll be
focussing my analysis on “data” jobs - namely data analysts and data
scientists.

### Pre-processing

The pre-processing steps are executed in *prepare\_data.r*. To
summarise, respondents are filtered as: \* salary above $30,000 and
below $2,000,000 \* full-time only \* self-identified data analyst or
data scientist

### What’s the difference between data analysts and data scientists?
