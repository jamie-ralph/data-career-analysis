**Analysing careers in data with the StackOverflow Developer Survey
2019**
================

<br>

This project was inspired by Julia Silge’s amazing analysis of [gender
and salary in the tech
industry](https://juliasilge.com/blog/salary-gender/). There’s a lot of
cool analysis that can be done with the survey data, but I’ll be
focussing my analysis on “data” jobs - namely data analysts and data
scientists.
